Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has been one of the most important imaging modalities for the assessment of left 
ventricular (LV) function. Extraction of LV myocardial mass contour with maximum perfusion is essential to quantify LV 
myocardial viability and mechanical dyssynchrony. However, due to the low resolution of single photon emission computed 
tomography (SPECT) images, it is still challenging to obtain LV myocardial mass contour with maximum perfusion, which 
can influence the accuracy and reproducibility of quantification of myocardial perfusion and dyssynchrony. 
In this work, we present a novel deep-learning-based method to automatically extract the LV myocardial mass contour with 
maximum perfusion from gated SPECT MPI.
